This build corresponds to the Perl 5.16.0 source code release.

=item *

The 1600 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with
builds in the 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1400 series.  Any extensions built using binaries
from the ActivePerl 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1400 series will need to be recompiled.
Note especially that this applies to PPM packages that may have been
built for 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1400 series builds.

=item *

Significant changes that have occurred in the 5.16.0 release
are documented in L<perl5160delta>.

=item *

Most bundled distributions have been updated to their latest released
version from CPAN.  Use the C<ppm list> command to check the exact
version included in this release.
