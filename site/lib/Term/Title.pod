=head1 NAME

Term::Title - Portable API to set the terminal titlebar

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Term::Title 'set_titlebar';
 
     set_titlebar("This goes into the title");
 
     set_titlebar("Title", "And also print this to the terminal");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Term::Title provides an abstraction for setting the titlebar (or title tab)
across different types of terminals.  For *nix terminals, it prints the
appropriate escape sequences to set the terminal title based on the value of
C<<< $ENV{TERM} >>>.  On Windows, it uses L<Win32::Console> to set the title directly.  

Currently, supported terminals include:

=item *

xterm

rxvt

screen

Win32 console

=head1 USAGE

=head2 C<<< set_titlebar() >>>

     set_titlebar( $title, @optional_text );

Sets the titlebar to C<<< $title >>> or clears the titlebar if C<<< $title >>> is 
undefined.   

On terminals that require printing escape codes to the terminal, a newline
character is also printed to the terminal.  If C<<<  @optional_text  >>> is given, it
will be printed to the terminal prior to the newline.  Thus, to keep terminal
output cleaner, use C<<< set_titlebar() >>> in place of a C<<< print() >>> statement to
set the titlebar and print at the same time.

If the terminal is not supported, set_titlebar silently continues, printing
C<<<  @optional_text  >>> if any.
